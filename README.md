IoT based water management app sample inspired by the water drinking app Watermaniac.

Features:
- Set a daily goal of water usage
- A history of all the water you used.
- Sample IoT gauge meters

It is simple, lightweight and built with Flutter and Dart. Only core functionalities. The notifications for water leakage and the IoT connection specifics are dummy values.
